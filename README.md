This repo consists of the basic python programs I coded while learning python.
I have tried to comment my code as well as possible.
If one needs more description about any of the codes, please contact me.

Hope these codes will be useful for a newbie.

Note: All codes are written using eclipse.
I pushed each eclipse project I created. I have all the source-code for each project in this repo in <project_name>/src folder.

I will like to learn more about python. If anyone wishes to contribute and add in to these demo codes, feel free to do so.
